# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26 2022, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed tribute page project from freecodecamps responsive web design certification and also learnt how to create github issues, branches and submit pull requests.

**Thoughts**: I got to apply everything that I learned and see how everything fits together. I faced difficulty when trying to use grid so I'll spend more time tomorrow reading mdn docs about it and practicing more.

### Day 1: April 27 2022, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about flexbox today.
I also really enjoyed completing challenges to test my learnings.
On  https://flexboxfroggy.com you can help tiny froggy get home and test your flexbox skills as well.

**Thoughts**: I faced difficulty in some of the flex properties like flex-basis, flex-shrinks and order. I'm still not confident in my knowledge of flex-box. That means I need more practics.
