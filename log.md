# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26 2022, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed tribute page project from freecodecamps responsive web design certification and also learnt how to create github issues, branches and submit pull requests.

**Thoughts**: I got to apply everything that I learned and see how everything fits together. I faced difficulty when trying to use grid so I'll spend more time tomorrow reading mdn docs about it and practicing more.
